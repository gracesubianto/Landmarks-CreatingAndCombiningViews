Tutorial: SwiftUI Essentials Creating and Combining Views

From the tutorial brief:
"This tutorial guides you through building Landmarks — an iOS app for discovering and sharing the places you love. 
You’ll start by building the view that shows a landmark’s details. To lay out the views, Landmarks uses stacks to combine 
and layer the image and text view components. To add a map to the view, you’ll include a standard MapKit component."
